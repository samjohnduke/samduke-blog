## Why

The tools available for creators on the web felt either too rigid or too complex. I wanted to build something that adapted to the way people actually work — not the other way around.

Chameleon Creator started as a side project born out of frustration. I kept building the same scaffolding for every new web project: auth, content management, deployment pipelines. Eventually I asked — what if this scaffolding *was* the product?

## What It Is

Chameleon Creator is a platform that gives creators and developers the building blocks to ship web projects fast. It handles the infrastructure so you can focus on what makes your project unique.

The stack is built on the edge — everything runs on Cloudflare Workers, which means sub-50ms response times globally. Content is stored in D1, assets in R2, and the whole thing is orchestrated through a TypeScript API layer.

## The Journey

Starting a company is exactly as chaotic as everyone says. The first version was embarrassingly rough — but it worked, and people used it. That taught me the most important lesson: ship early, listen hard, iterate fast.

The hardest part hasn't been the technology. It's been learning to make decisions with incomplete information, prioritizing ruthlessly, and staying focused when there are a hundred things that feel urgent.

## What I've Learned

- **Edge-first architecture** changes how you think about data and latency
- **Developer experience** is a feature, not a nice-to-have
- The best tools are the ones that **get out of your way**
- Building a company is a crash course in everything you thought you knew
